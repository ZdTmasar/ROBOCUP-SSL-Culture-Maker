# ROBOCUP-SSL-Culture-Maker
This is the work of LOO Darren, LAKHAL Nada, SEHOUBO Victoire and SALIBA Thomas for Rhoban SSL team

You will find a report on the repository explaining everything done during the project.

Basically there is :
-> How to make an identification of a motor
-> How to calculate a PID corrector
-> How to implemente the corrector
-> How to build a TestBench for a motor

If you are intersted in the SSL and more particularly with Rhoban, be sure to contact them. The remaining of the code is with them !

If you have any problem or questions about our work, be sure to contact us ;)
